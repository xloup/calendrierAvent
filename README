example of an application built with yeoman, backbone/require.js with miso.ds link to a public document on google drive

the app is auto- inserting itself into a pre-existent site - this site's CSS is missing so the presentation in index.html
is only indicative

The application shows 24 buttons, each one is activated on the corresponding day on december 2013.
the click on the button shows the corresponding vine video - taken from google drive
